            <p class="sectionSubTag textSmall">Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education
                system, which fall under the command of the government at three levels: federal, state and local. Under
                various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education
                Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14.
                The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. Major policy initiatives in
                Indian education are numerous. Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined
                legally by each of India’s constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made
                education a ‘concurrent subject’. From this point on the central and state governments shared formal
                responsibility for funding and administration of education. State governments and local government
                bodies manage the majority of primary and upper primary schools and the number of government-managed
                elementary schools is growing. Simultaneously the number and proportion managed by private bodies is
                growing. In 2005-6 83.13% of schools offering elementary education (Grades 1-8) were managed by
                government and 16.86% of schools were under private management (excluding children in unrecognised
                schools, schools established under the Education Guarantee Scheme and in alternative learning centers).

            <p class="sectionSubTag textSmall">Although there are private schools in India, they are highly regulated in
                terms of what they can teach, in what form they can operate (must be a non-profit to run any accredited
                educational institution) and all the other aspects of operation. Hence, the differentiation of
                government schools and private schools can be misleading.[23] However, in a report by Geeta Gandhi
                Kingdon entitled: The emptying of public Schools and growth of private schools in India, it is said that
                For sensible education policy making, it is vital to take account of the changing trends in the size of
                the private and public schooling sectors in India. Ignoring these trends involves the risk of poor
                policies/legislation, with attendant adverse consequences for children’s life chances. In a country as
                large as India, now with 28 states and eight union territories, this means that the potential for
                variations between states in the policies, plans, programs and initiatives for elementary education is
                vast. Periodically, national policy frameworks are created to guide states in their creation of
                state-level programs and policies. </p>
